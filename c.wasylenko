           #  and ITNW, NWTN control the stepsize. In fact, pseudo-arclength is used for “continuation in
           #  time”. Note that the time discretization is only first order accurate, so that results should
           #  be carefully interpreted. Indeed, this option has been included primarily for the detection
           #  of stationary solutions, which can then be entered in the user-supplied routine STPNT.

           #  - IPS=2 : Computation of periodic solutions. Starting data can be a Hopf bifurcation

           #  analytically known periodic orbit (Run 1 of demo frc), or a numerically known periodic

           #  - IPS=11 : Spatially uniform solutions of a system of parabolic PDEs, with detection of
           #  traveling wave bifurcations. The user need only define the nonlinearity (in routine FUNC),
           #  initialize the wave speed in PAR(10), initialize the diffusion constants in PAR(15,16,· · · ),

IRS  = 0  # This constant sets the label of the solution where the computation is to be restarted.
          #  - IRS=0 : This setting is typically used in the first run of a new problem. In this case a
          #  starting solution must be defined in the user-supplied routine STPNT. For representative
          #  examples of analytical starting solutions see demos ab and frc. For starting from unlabeled
          #  numerical data see the dat command above, and demos lor and pen.
          #  - IRS>0 : Restart the computation at the previously computed solution with label IRS.
          #  This solution is normally expected to be in the current data-file s.xxx; see also the @r and
          #  @R commands in Section 5. Various AUTO-constants can be modified when restarting.
          #  - IRS<0 : Restart the computation at the -IRSth computed solution in the restart file. This
          #  is especially useful if you do not want to look up label numbers and know for sure that
          #  the solution to continue from is at a fixed position.

# try ISP=2 and ISP=0 and ISP=1
ISP  = 2  # - ISP=0 : This setting disables the detection of Hopf bifurcations, branch points, period-
          #  doubling bifurcations, and torus bifurcations and the computation of Floquet multipliers.
          #  - ISP=1 : Branch points and Hopf bifurcations are detected for algebraic equations. Branch
          #  points, period-doubling bifurcations and torus bifurcations are not detected for periodic
          #  solutions and boundary value problems. However, Floquet multipliers are computed.
          #  - ISP=2 : This setting enables the detection of all special solutions. For periodic solutions
          #  and rotations, the choice ISP=2 should be used with care, due to potential inaccuracy in
          #  the computation of the linearized Poincare map and possible rapid variation of the Floquet
          #  multipliers. The linearized Poincare map always has a multiplier z = 1. If this multiplier
          #  becomes inaccurate then the automatic detection of secondary periodic bifurcations will
          #  be discontinued and a warning message will be printed in fort.9. See also Section 11.4.
          #  - ISP=3 : Hopf bifurcations will not be detected. Branch points will be detected, and
          #  AUTO will monitor the Floquet multipliers. Period-doubling and torus bifurcations will go
          #  undetected. This option is useful for certain problems with non-generic Floquet behavior.
          #  - ISP=4 : Branch points and Hopf bifurcations are detected for algebraic equations. Branch
          #  points are not detected for periodic solutions and boundary value problems. AUTO will
          #  monitor the Floquet multipliers, and period-doubling and torus bifurcations will be detected.
ISW  = 1  # This constant controls branch switching at branch points for the case of differential equations.
          #  Note that branch switching is automatic for algebraic equations.
          #  - ISW=1 : This is the normal value of ISW.
          #  - ISW=−1 : If IRS is the label of a branch point or a period-doubling bifurcation then branch
          #  switching will be done. For period doubling bifurcations it is recommended that NTST be
          #  increased. For examples see Run 2 and Run 3 of demo lor, where branch switching is
          #  done at period-doubling bifurcations, and Run 2 and Run 3 of demo bvp, where branch
          #  switching is done at a transcritical branch point.
          #  - ISW=2 : If IRS is the label of a fold, a Hopf bifurcation point, a period-doubling, a torus
          #  bifurcation, or, in a non-generic (symmetric) system, a branch point then a locus of such
          #  points will be computed. An additional free parameter must be specified for such continuations; see also Section 10.7.
          #  - ISW=3 : If IRS is the label of a branch point in a generic (non-symmetric) system then a locus of such points will be computed. Two additional free parameters must be specified
          #  for such continuations; see also Section 10.7.

MXBF = 10  # This constant, which is effective for algebraic problems only, sets the maximum number of bifurcations to be treated.
IID  = 2  # This constant controls the amount of diagnostic output printed in fort.9 : the greater IID the
          #  more detailed the diagnostic output.
          #  - IID=0 : No diagnostic output.
          #  - IID=1 : Minimal diagnostic output. This setting is not recommended.
          #  - IID=2 : Regular diagnostic output. This is the recommended value of IID.
          #  - IID=3 : This setting gives additional diagnostic output for algebraic equations, namely the
          #  Jacobian and the residual vector at the starting point. This information, which is printed
          #  at the beginning of fort.9, is useful for verifying whether the starting solution in STPNT
          #  is indeed a solution.
          #  - IID=4 : This setting gives additional diagnostic output for differential equations, namely
          #  the reduced system and the associated residual vector. This information is printed for ev-
          #  ery step and for every Newton iteration, and should normally be suppressed. In particular
          #  it can be used to verify whether the starting solution is indeed a solution. For this purpose,
          #  the stepsize DS should be small, and one should look at the residuals printed in the fort.9
          #  output-file. (Note that the first residual vector printed in fort.9 may be identically zero,
          #  as it may correspond to the computation of the starting direction. Look at the second
          #  residual vector in such case.) This residual vector has dimension NDIM+NBC+NINT+1,
          #  which accounts for the NDIM differential equations, the NBC boundary conditions, the NINT
          #  user-defined integral constraints, and the pseudo-arclength equation. For proper inter-
          #  pretations of these data one may want to refer to the solution algorithm for solving the
          #  collocation system, as described in Doedel, Keller & Kernevez (1991b).
          #  - IID=5 : This setting gives very extensive diagnostic output for differential equations,
          #  namely, debug output from the linear equation solver. This setting should not normally
          #  be used as it may result in a huge fort.9 file. It gives incomplete results when used in
          #  combination with MPI parallellization.
